      <description>&lt;p&gt;Born and raised up in a beautiful country named Bangladesh. Done my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering, and Masters in Information Technology. A Software Engineer by profession, expertise lies mainly in the back-end and cloud environment with technologies such as nodejs, mongoDB, docker, kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keen to learn and explore new technologies. I would like to explore more in these areas: Docker, Microservice, Kubernetes, Cloud service, Machine Learning, Cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;

Like to play Bowling and billiards as well.&lt;/p&gt;
